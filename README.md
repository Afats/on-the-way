# OTW: On The Way

A Hi-Fi prototype app design for NSW transport. Accessibility issues were taken into account while designing the UI and UX.
View the prototype design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/nuzwB6PQi3Hxym1HSbgkw1/On-The-Way?node-id=0%3A1).
Design based on apple design components for iPhoneX and above. But the app will work on every smartphone.

The Expo App:
Clone repo and run expo start in the master branch to view the app. (You will probably need to install React Expo related packages)
Swipe right to go back to the Dashboard at anytime :)
